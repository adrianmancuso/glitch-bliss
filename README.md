## movement based glitch-bliss project

A short front-end project based on HTML5's ability to access accellator data and the Javascript _Web Audio API_.  Each direction is mapped to a looper to create some glitched out effects. iOS users will want to turn their ringer sound on first, because webaudio api and iOS don't play well together. This is a WIP - planning much more stuff soon
